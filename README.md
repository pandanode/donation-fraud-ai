<div align="center"> <hi>🛡️ Donation Fraud Detection AI</hi><br>

An AI-powered system that detects fraudulent donation transactions using FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and machine learning classifiers to detect scam donation messages, fake NGOs, and suspicious payment channels. 
The system integrates government NGO registry verification and deploys models via REST APIs with real-time risk scoring and explainable decisions.

<br>
## 🚀 Project Overview

Donation platforms are vulnerable to fraud activities such as fake campaigns, suspicious transactions, and bot-generated donations. 

This project uses machine learning models to analyze transaction patterns and classify them as:

- ✅ Legitimate
- ❌ Fraudulent

The goal is to build a scalable AI system that can assist fintech platforms in fraud prevention.

Scope of the Project

This system will focus on:

--NGO authenticity verification using Indian regulatory data sources.
--Detection of fake donation websites and impersonation campaigns.
--NLP-based scam message classification.
--QR code and UPI payment risk validation.
--Storage and auditing of fraud detection decisions.
--A donor-facing web interface and admin dashboard.
